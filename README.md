It could be more efficient to make a jack-o-lantern function that utilizes 
the pumpkin and carved functions together so they will be less likely to 
draw in unexpected places. However, unless you are drawing tons of the same 
jack-o-lantern, it might be too specific as a function. It depends what you
need in your program.

Also, my stars aren't touching the stems? I put the star function first just
in case but they didn't end up overlapping after all.
